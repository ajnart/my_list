# Passport

My **second** Flutter project.

## What does it do ?
Although in version 0.1, it aims to provide a simple and sleek startup name generator :rocket:
### At the moment it does:
* Displays a list of random Statup names
* Theme is dependent on the system theme (Dark / Light)
* You can save liked names by clicking the red heart on the right

*ATM the liked names are not saved in a file.*

### **What i want to add:**
* A settings button on the top right corner to set the theme
* Save the data to a file so it stays on reboot.

Thank you for reading.
