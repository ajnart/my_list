# Passport

My **first** Flutter project.

## What does it do ?
Although in version 0.1, it aims to provide a simple and sleek app to show your personal card.
### At the moment it does:
* Displays the Name, UserName, Email and Phone number
* Theme is dependent on the system theme (Dark / Light)
* Display an image in a round box at the top
* It has a personalised splashscreen

*ATM the variables can only be changed in the code.*

### **What i want to add:**
* A settings button on the top right corner to set the theme
* A "change image" button when clicking the image
* A "new item" button on the bottom to add new items
* Save the data to a file so it stays on reboot.

Thank you for reading.
